# Artifact contract

Contract 4 defines the shared HTML base: appearance, contextual review, typography, sound, reading navigation and stable document metadata. Use the generator for new work rather than copying a historical example. The contract preserves dotted, fading frames on wide figures and a consistent reader dock.

## Generate

```bash
python3 scripts/create_artifact.py --content /path/content.html --title 'Operational review' --document-id operations-review --theme linear --mode light --typography sobrio --output /path/review.html
python3 scripts/validate_artifact.py /path/review.html
```

Use `--help` for chapter input and supported options. Titles and IDs must be escaped; each heading/section target must be unique. The same logical document retains its ID across title changes and revisions. New documents get new IDs. Do not fabricate session or device metadata.

## Structure

The generator embeds complete fonts, CSS and required modules. Wide `.ancho` or `.amplio` figures are siblings of text sections inside `.hoja` or `.pagina`; nesting them in a narrow paragraph column breaks their width. Multipage documents use a grid on each `.pagina`, not a competing grid on the outer wrapper. Chapter navigation is page navigation; local content tabs use tab semantics.

The base includes one appearance menu and one review surface. The hosted adapter negotiates permissions without passing credentials into artifact HTML. Theme and typography preferences are reader-specific; published source remains immutable. Preserve existing metadata keys such as `nota-documento` and runtime globals for compatibility.

## Validation

The validator checks required modules, recorded hashes, IDs, dependencies, metadata, theme settings and contract structure. It cannot prove visual quality, human-perceived sound, keyboard ergonomics or WebGL behavior. Also inspect desktop, 320/390 px, light/dark modes, reduced motion and fallback states in a browser. Do not hide document overflow to pass a layout check.

Source HTML and generated assets must agree. Rebuild after runtime or recipe changes. A historical artifact is not automatically upgraded by updating an agent's skill; regenerate and publish a new revision with the same ID. The portal may provide current reader chrome without altering stored source versions.

## Publication

Validate locally, upload a draft, review it, then promote using the expected current version. Keep permissions and audience unchanged unless explicitly requested. New artifacts are private by default. See [portal operations](portal-operations.md) and [the unified workspace](unified-workspace.md).
